- [R4B1T H0L3 motion board](R4B1T_H0L3_MOTION_BOARD.html) — approved motion language for the production mark (state priority, transform ownership, reduced motion); implemented in `r4b1t-h0l3-production.svg`

The `Corpus Quality` workflow generates source-hash-bound JSON and Markdown artifacts and enforces `.github/corpus-policy.json` as the reviewed non-regression baseline. `.github/corpus-policy.example.json` is the stricter target state; it is not currently enforced because the measured corpus does not yet satisfy it.

The `Pool Sweep Evidence` workflow is report-only. Its network observations are uploaded for review and cannot directly replace or push the canonical corpus.
