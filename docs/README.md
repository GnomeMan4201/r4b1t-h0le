The `Corpus Quality` workflow generates source-hash-bound JSON and Markdown artifacts and enforces `.github/corpus-policy.json` as the reviewed non-regression baseline. `.github/corpus-policy.example.json` is the stricter target state; it is not currently enforced because the measured corpus does not yet satisfy it.

The `Pool Sweep Evidence` workflow is report-only. Its network observations are uploaded for review and cannot directly replace or push the canonical corpus.
